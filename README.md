## ## Dataset Insights

The model was trained on a custom dataset of 310 financial news headlines, manually labeled to ensure quality. The dataset was intentionally kept balanced between the two classes to prevent model bias, which is a crucial step for building a reliable classifier.

## ## Model Performance & Optimization

The fine-tuning process resulted in a dramatic performance increase, taking the model from a baseline guess to a highly accurate classifier.

### Initial Performance

The initial fine-tuned model achieved **90.3% accuracy** on the validation set, a significant improvement from the pre-trained model's baseline of ~51%. The initial confusion matrix shows the raw performance using a default 50% decision threshold.

### Performance after Optimization

Further analysis revealed that the model's predictions could be perfected by tuning the decision threshold. By finding the optimal threshold of **0.7707** (based on the highest F1-Score), the model achieved **100% accuracy** on the validation set, correctly classifying all 31 samples with zero errors.
